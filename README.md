## 1. maze  
 - find shortest path using BFS and A star Algorithm  
 - Heuristic function  
     1) Manhattan Distance  
     2) Max of Manhattan Distance for all the objectives  
     3) MST about start point and objectives  
 - category(each stage has 3 files small.txt, medium.txt, big.txt)  
    - stage1: one objective  
    - stage2: four objectives  
    - stage3: many objectives  
## 2. pacman  
 - play game using minimax, alphabeta pruning and expectimax algorithm  
 - Win Rate
    1) Minimax Agent: 50%~70%  
    2) AlphaBeta Pruning Agent: just faster than Minimax Agent
    3) Expectimax Agent: about 50%
